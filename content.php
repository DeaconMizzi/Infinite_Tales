                        <div class="col-md-12"><p>Here is the riveting story of acclaimed actor Matthew Perry, who takes us along on his journey from childhood ambition to fame to addiction and recovery in the aftermath of a life-threatening health scare. 
                            Before the frequent hospital visits and stints in rehab, there was five-year-old Matthew, who travelled from Montreal to Los Angeles, 
                            shuffling between his separated parents; fourteen-year-old Matthew, who was a nationally ranked tennis star in Canada; twenty-four-year-old Matthew, 
                            who nabbed a coveted role as a lead cast member on the talked-about pilot then called Friends Like Us. . . and so much more.</p></div>
                        <div class="col-md-12"><p>In an extraordinary story that only he could tell - and in the heartfelt, hilarious, and warmly familiar way only he could tell it - 
                            Matthew Perry lays bare the fractured family that raised him (and also left him to his own devices), the desire for recognition that drove him to fame, and the void 
                            inside him that could not be filled even by his greatest dreams coming true. But he also details the peace he's found in sobriety and how he feels about the ubiquity of Friends, 
                            sharing stories about his castmates and other stars he met along the way. Frank, self-aware, and with his trademark humour, Perry vividly depicts his lifelong battle with 
                            addiction and what fuelled it despite seemingly having it all.</p></div>
                        <div class="col-md-12"><p>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing is an unforgettable memoir that is both intimate and eye-opening - 
                            as well as a hand extended to anyone struggling with sobriety. Unflinchingly honest, moving, and uproariously funny, 
                            this is the book fans have been waiting for.</p></div>
